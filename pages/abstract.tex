In-database processing of data mining algorithms enables high-performance, real-time data analysis on up-to-date data, without the need of an additional system or software. Therefore, data mining algorithms have to be implemented in the database engine. In this work we present an approach that integrates data mining with HyPer, a high-performance hybrid OLTP \& OLAP main memory database system.
\\
As a proof-of-concept, the k-Means clustering algorithm is implemented as a HyPer operator benefiting of efficient code compilation. Two serial versions of the k-Means algorithm are implemented, demonstrating the possibilites of operator implementations in HyPer: One version with a strong focus on high-level C++ constructs, and a second version based on low-level code compilation techniques. Furthermore, a parallel version shows the advances of running data mining algorithms on multi core machine. 
\\
Extensive experiments demonstrate  the benefits of the low-level code compilation techniques over high-level C++ code. This insight can be used as building block for further data mining algorithms. Furthermore, the experiments on a varity of data sets show that the HyPer k-Means operator is able to compete with existing solutions such as Julia and R, and even outnumbers them regarding the parallel implementation.
