\chapter{Hyper}\label{chapter:hyper}

In this section, the relational main-memory database system HyPer is introduced. HyPer is a database system combining both OLTP and OLAP processing and is the main research subject of this work: Extending HyPer in order to execute data mining algorithms directly in the relational database.
As already mentioned, historically, databases are disk-based systems separated into two parts: A OLTP system, optimized for high rates of mission-critical, transactional write requests, and a OLTP system, executing long-running queries. The data synchronization between the two systems is ensured with an ETL process: Data is extracted from the OLTP system, transformed and loaded into the OLAP system. Since this process implicates heavy load on the database, it is usually done periodically, e.g. over night. 
Obviously, this architecture reveals several drawbacks. The periodical execution of the ETL process results in stale data in the OLAP system, i.e. when implementing a nightly ETL process, data can be outdated for up to 24 hours which can be problematic for some data analysis problems. Two systems lead to a higher amount of infrastructure and maintaining cost. Hardware and software costs must be taken into account, as well as maintenance cost and incident management. Additionally, implementing an ETL process can make a system overly complex in contrast of using one system.
Addressing these challenges the HyPer main-memory system was developed, with the goals to process OLTP transactions with high performance and throughput, and, on the same system, process OLAP queries on up-to-date data. In the following we give a short overview about the HyPer system architecture.
Major performance gains are realized by omitting typical disk-based database characteristics, that are not necessary any more when data resides in main memory. Therefore, database-specific buffer management and page structuring is not necessary anymore. Instead, data is stored in main-memory optimized data structures within the virtual memory. Hence, HyPer can use the highly efficient address-translation of the operating system without any additional indirection.
OLTP processing is highly efficient because all the data is already loaded in main memory, and the very slow disk access is omitted and no bottleneck anymore. Therefore, transactions do never have to wait for I/O and can be executed very quick. Thus, HyPer implements OLTP transactions as single-threaded approach and executes all transactions sequentially. This is possible because the execution time of an OLTP transaction is only around ten microseconds and even without parallel execution of transactions, a high throughput is achievable. Another advantage of this simple model is that locking and latching of data objects becomes redundant since only one transaction is active for the entire database. This simplifies the implementation of the database.
Obviously, the sequential execution of transactions is only possible if there arenâ€™t any long-running transactions. Long-running transactions would be a bottleneck for the entire database and must be handled in a different way. Therefore we will now look at how HyPer deals with long-running queries and OLAP-style queries in general.
HyPer considers OLAP queries as a new process and creates a snapshots of the virtual memory of the OLTP process for the OLAP processes. In Unix, this is done by forking the OLTP process and creating a child process for the OLAP process, exploiting the virtual memory functionality of the operating system. The OLAP process takes an exact copy of the OLTP system on process creation, and is now able to execute long running queries without interfering the OLTP transaction throughput. Thanks to modern operating systems, the creation of snapshots is very efficient because the memory segments are not physically copied. Instead, operating systems apply a copy-on-update strategy. That means, that both OLTP and OLAP process are sharing the same physical main memory location since both of their virtual address translation maps to the same segments. Therefore copying the memory on creation is not necessary. Only when a object is updated by the OLTP process, a new page gets created for the OLTP process, while the OLAP virtual memory page is still the one available when the process was created. Since this mechanism is supported by hardware, it is very fast and there is no implementation overhead in the HyPer system. Experiments have shown that the fork can be achieved in about 10 ms, almost independent of the size of the OLTP system.
So far we have shown how HyPer executes long-running OLAP queries parallel to high-throughput OLTP transactions by using virtual memory snapshots. Since OLAP queries are read-only HyPer can execute them in parallel in multiple threads sharing the same snapshot. As in the sequential execution, not locking and latching is necessary because the used data structures are immutable. This inter-query parallelization can tremendously speed up query processing on multi-core computers.
Another approach is the creation of multiple OLAP session by forking the OLTP memory periodically. New OLAP
